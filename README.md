# AI-ML Practice Projects  

This repository contains beginner-friendly AI/ML projects built for practice and learning purposes.  
Each project demonstrates fundamental concepts of data analysis, machine learning, and clustering.  

## Projects  

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset  
- Performed data cleaning and visualization to analyze passenger demographics and survival rates.  
- Tools: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib  

### 2. Predictive Model – House Prices (Linear Regression)  
- Built a Linear Regression model to predict house prices using the Boston Housing dataset.  
- Evaluated performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score.  
- Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn  

### 3. Clustering with K-Means (Iris Dataset)  
- Applied K-Means clustering to group Iris flowers into clusters based on sepal and petal measurements.  
- Visualized clusters using scatter plots.  
- Tools: Python, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
